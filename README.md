# neural-numpy
Simple neural network only using numpy
There are no easy way to change and configure hyperparameters
The results vary and are in a horrible range between 60% and 80%
No random seed is set
The only purpose of this project was to get a good understanding about how a neural network works and to that end detailed comments are added to increase the understanding of anyone interested to read the code.
