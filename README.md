# neural-numpy
Really simple two-layer nerual network which tries to classify hand-drawn letters from 0-9 from the minist dataset.
The only purpose of the project was to showcase the inner workings of how a neural network works which it does. 

The resulting model varies a lot because there isen't a set random seed. There are also no validation datasets or any easy way to adjust the hyperparameters at all. 
There are no learning rate decay, the model isen't supposed to be used after training at all. 
The plotting is primitive, and overfitting occurs at every run, but the comments are detailed.
